						<p>
							LaSR (pronounced 'Laser') uses zero-shot queries to a large language model (LLM)

							Symbolic regression is the task of finding a mathematical
							expression that best fits a given dataset. The goal is to find a compact, interpretable
							expression that can be used to make predictions and infer new relationships. Symbolic
							regression is a key tool in scientific discovery, as it can help uncover hidden
							relationships in the data and suggest new hypotheses to test.
						</p>
						<p>
							One of the earliest known example of symbolic regression is Johannes Kepler's discovery of
							the empirical laws of planetary motion. Kepler fit various geometric shapes to the ground
							truth celestial data and found that elliptical orbits best explained the data. Kepler's work
							in transforming the empirical data into a set of mathematical relationships paved
							the way for broader interpretation. For instance, Newton validates his laws of motion and
							his law of universal gravitation by showing that the empirical relationships discoverd by
							Kepler are a consequence of his laws. In this way, the interpretation of empirical law in
							one phenomena often generalizes to and explains other phenomena that didn't have a-priori
							data collection mechanisms.

						Regression</h3>
					<div class="content is-size-7-mobile is-size-6-tablet has-text-left">
						<p>
							PySR is a framework for symbolic regression that implements search using multi-population
							genetic programming.
							Intuitively, for each population, PySR runs a tournament to select the programs with the
							highest fitness score.
							These programs are randomly mutated / crossed with each other to
							produce new programs. These new programs replace the oldest candidate. This process is
							repeated for a fixed
							number
							of iteration and, in implementation, can be parallelized across multiple cores. This
							enables scalable exploration of a large search space, and is crucial for PySR's success.
						</p>
						<p>
							However, PySR does not allow for the incorporation of prior knowledge or domain-specific
							concepts. This can make it difficult to discover complex relationships, especially in
							scientific
							domains where the data is noisy and/or high-dimensional but supplemented with rich
							background knowledge.
						</p>
						<p>
							This fundamental limitation surfaces as an <em>exploration bottleneck</em>.

					<div class="content is-size-7-mobile is-size-6-tablet has-text-left step">
						<p>
							PySR's search strategy is essentially a form of "local search." That is, each population
							starts
							with a randomly sampled set of programs and iteratively optimizes them by sampling programs
							that are <strong>syntactically close</strong> to the best programs in the population. This
							process continues until a local optimum is reached. Intuitively, this forms an "island"
							in the search space of programs.
						</p>
						<p>
							As PySR runs multiple populations in parallel, we end up with a disjoint set of "islands" in
							the search space. Now, PySR has many heuristics to deal with such "islands" -- for instance,
							by migrating programs between populations. However, there is no obvious way to overcome this

							Our hypothesis is that the islands emerge because PySR (or any symbolic algorithm) can only
							sample programs that are <strong>syntactically close</strong> to the best program in each

							But syntactic closeness does not necessarily imply semantic closeness. Can we instead sample

						Abstraction</h3>
					<div class="content is-size-7-mobile is-size-6-tablet has-text-left step">
						<p>
							We're going to achieve this by abstracting programs into relevant concepts. A concept is a
							natural language representation of a program. In symbolic regression, our programs are
							equations.
							Hence, we desire two properties from a concept: (1) Symbolic Abstraction and (2) Symbolic
							guidance.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Symbolic Abstraction:</strong> A concept captures an abstract property that is
							common to
							a set of programs. For instance, many empirical trends such as Zipf's law (Linguistics),
							Moore's law (Computer Science),
							and Arrhenius' equation (Chemistry) can be represented by the equation sketch:
							$$y = a x^k + \epsilon$$

							This trend is pervasive across many domains and is commonly referred to as a "power law."
							This is just one example of how a concept can "summarize" an important property of a set of
							programs.

						<p>
							<strong>Symbolic Guidance</strong>: A concept can also guide the search for new programs.
							This arises naturally
							from the abstraction property: if a concept is a good abstraction of a set of equations, we
							should be able to
							use it to sample new equations that are similar to the ones in the set.
						</p>
						<p>
							This is particularly useful in scientific discovery, where scientists often have a
							preconception of how certain
							variables will interact with each other, but may not know the exact form of the
							relationship<em>
								(The example with gravitational waves is a little misleading as the theoretical

						<p>
							LaSR consists of three phases: <em>Hypothesis Evolution</em>, <em>Concept Abstraction</em>,
							and <em>Concept Evolution</em>. In
							<em>Hypothesis Evolution</em>, we search for programs that best fit the data and are guided
							by concepts discovered in the previous iteration.
							<em>Concept Abstraction</em> deals with updating the concept library with new concepts
							derived from the best
							performing programs. Finally, <em>Concept Evolution</em> involves updating the concept
							library with new concepts that are implications of the discovered concepts.
						</p>
						<p>
							This is a self-amplifying loop: better programs lead to better concepts, which can, in turn,
							guide the search for even better programs.

					<h3 class="title is-size-6-mobile is-size-4-tablet">LaSR: Phase 1 Hypothesis Evolution</h3>
					<div class="content is-size-7-mobile is-size-6-tablet has-text-left step">
						<p>
							The hypothesis evolution searches for programs that best fit the data and are guided by

							search process to incorporate concept guidance.
							The next few slides will detail how we do this.
						</p>

					<h3 class="title is-size-6-mobile is-size-4-tablet">Phase 1: Base Algorithm</h3>
					<div class="content is-size-7-mobile is-size-6-tablet has-text-left step">
						<p>
							We build upon PySR's multi-population genetic programming framework to integrate concept
							guidance.
							Let's begin by understanding PySR's main loop first. Assuming \(k\) programs in a single
							population, PySR starts with
							a randomly initialized set of programs \( \left( \{Pi_1^1, \dots \Pi_1^k \} \right) \),
							from which the best program is selected \( \left( \pi_1^\star \right) \)
							by evaluating its fitness on a supervised dataset. This program undergoes either mutation (a
							part of the program is resampled),
							crossover (a part of the program is swapped with a part of the second best program),
							simplification (the program is simplified), or
							optimization (the constants in the program are optimized). The generated program replaces
							the oldest program in the population, and the process
							repeats for a fixed number of iterations. Each iteration takes less than a second, and many
							such populations can be run in parallel.
						</p>

					<h3 class="title is-size-6-mobile is-size-4-tablet">Phase 1: LLM Operations </h3>
					<div class="content is-size-7-mobile is-size-6-tablet has-text-left step">
						<p>
							Integrating concept guidance into PySR involves augmenting all symbolic operations that
							generate new programs with
							an LLM zero shot query that mimics the symbolic operation it is replacing
						</p>
						<p>
							Instead of fully replacing the symbolic operations, we propose a hybrid approach where we
							replace the symbolic operation with the LLM
							zero shot query with probability \(p\) (usually 1%). This allows us to incorporate the
							concept guidance into the search process without
							sacrificing the 'local search' nature of PySR.
						</p>

					<h3 class="title is-size-6-mobile is-size-4-tablet">Phase 1: Concept Library Integration</h3>
					<div class="content is-size-7-mobile is-size-6-tablet has-text-left step">
						<p>
							Each LLM zero shot query is conditioned on concepts discovered in the previous iteration.
							These concepts are stored in a concept library

					<div class="content is-size-7-mobile is-size-6-tablet has-text-left step">
						<p>
							Next, the best performing programs are abstracted into concepts. We rely on another LLM zero

					<div class="content is-size-7-mobile is-size-6-tablet has-text-left step">
						<p>
							Let's take a step back and understand the intuition behind LaSR. We noted that
							PySR's ends up with "islands" in the search space because it can only sample programs

							PySR,
							we will also end up with these "islands" in the search space at the end of Phase 1.

					<div class="content is-size-7-mobile is-size-6-tablet has-text-left step">
						<p>
							We can now sample new programs conditioned on the discovered concepts. This allows us to

							LaSR doesn't require human provided concepts. Hence, we can test LaSR against other
							symbolic regression algorithms on the Feynman equations; a collection of equations that
							describe empirical relationships from the <a
								href="https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/">Feynman Lectures Series</a> .
							We found that LaSR outperforms other symbolic regression algorithms on this benchmark.
						</p>
						<p>
							LaSR's performance is ultimately bottlenecked by the quality of the language guidance. To
							evaluate this,
							we conducted a set of cascading experiments where we varied the quality of the language
							guidance by (1) increasing
							the probability of replacing symbolic operations with LLM zero shot queries and (2) changing
							the backend LLM model.
							We found that even a small model like <a href="https://github.com/meta-llama/llama3">Llama 3

							Equation #10 from the Feynman
							equations dataset: Coulomb's law. LaSR and PySR both discover a high performing program for
							this equation. Coulomb's law
							is interesting because it embodies multiple concepts: (1) The force and the distance of the
							charges are inversely proportional and follow a
							"power law" trend, (2) In the scalar form, the force is proportional to the product of the
							charges and since multiplication is commutative,
							the order of the charges does not matter.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>PySR's equation:</strong> PySR's equation is unwieldy and simplifies to the correct

							<strong>Limitations:</strong> As a consequence of using LLM zero shot queries, LaSR cannot
